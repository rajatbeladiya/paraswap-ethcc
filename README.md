# ParaSwap Swap

ParaSwap Swap is making swaps between EVM based assets.

For this I have used [ParaSwap API](https://developers.paraswap.network/api/list-all-tokens "ParaSwap API"). API allows any developer to retrieve Token prices as well as making swaps between EVM based assets (Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and others).
